      <h3> Should You Buy NFTs?</h3>
      Just because you can buy NFTs, does that mean you should? It depends, Yu
      says. “NFTs are risky because their future is uncertain, and we don’t yet
      have a lot of history to judge their performance,” she notes. “Since NFTs
      are so new, it may be worth investing small amounts to try it out for
      now.”
      <br />
      <br />
      In other words, investing in NFTs is a largely personal decision. If you
      have money to spare, it may be worth considering, especially if a piece
      holds meaning for you. But keep in mind, an NFT’s value is based entirely
      on what someone else is willing to pay for it. Therefore, demand will
      drive the price rather than fundamental, technical or economic indicators,
      which typically influence stock prices and at least generally form the
      basis for investor demand.
      <br />
      <br />
      All this means, an NFT may resale for less than you paid for it. Or you
      may not be able to resell it at all if no one wants it. Bear in mind, NFTs
      may also be subject to tax as will the cryptocurrencies used to purchase
      the NFT be. The Indian Budget 2022 proposed imposing withholding tax on
      transfer of virtual digital assets — which should include NFTs and
      cryptocurrencies — effective July 1. A tax deduction at source is also
      proposed. It is yet to be seen how the taxation will work and that means
      you may want to check in with a tax professional when considering adding
      NFTs to your portfolio.
      <br />
      <br />
      That said, approach NFTs just like you would any investment: Do your
      research, understand the risks—including that you might lose all of your
      investing rupees—and if you decide to take the plunge, proceed with a
      healthy dose of caution.
      <h3> How to Buy NFTs</h3>
      If you’re keen to start your own NFT collection, you’ll need to acquire
      some key items: First, you’ll need to get a digital wallet that allows you
      to store NFTs and cryptocurrencies. You’ll likely need to purchase some
      cryptocurrency, like Ether, depending on what currencies your NFT provider
      accepts. You can buy crypto using a credit card on platforms like
      Coinbase, Kraken, eToro and even PayPal and Robinhood now. You’ll then be
      able to move it from the exchange to your wallet of choice.
      <br />
      <br />
      You’ll want to keep fees in mind as you research options. Most exchanges
      charge at least a percentage of your transaction when you buy crypto.
      <h3>Popular NFT Marketplaces</h3>
      Once you’ve got your wallet set up and funded, there’s no shortage of NFT
      sites to shop. Currently, the largest NFT marketplaces are:
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>OpenSea.io:</b> This peer-to-peer platform bills itself a purveyor of
      “rare digital items and collectibles.” To get started, all you need to do
      is create an account to browse NFT collections. You can also sort pieces
      by sales volume to discover new artists.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Rarible:</b> Similar to OpenSea, Rarible is a democratic, open
      marketplace that allows artists and creators to issue and sell NFTs. RARI
      tokens issued on the platform enable holders to weigh in on features like
      fees and community rules.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Foundation:</b> Here, artists must receive “upvotes” or an invitation
      from fellow creators to post their art. The community’s exclusivity and
      cost of entry—artists must also purchase “gas” to mint NFTs—means it may
      boast higher-caliber artwork. For instance, Nyan Cat creator Chris Torres
      sold the NFT on the Foundation platform. It may also mean higher prices —
      not necessarily a bad thing for artists and collectors seeking to
      capitalize, assuming the demand for NFTs remains at current levels, or
      even increases over time.
      <br />
      <br />
      Although these platforms and others are host to thousands of NFT creators
      and collectors, be sure you do your research carefully before buying. Some
      artists have fallen victim to impersonators who have listed and sold their
      work without their permission.
