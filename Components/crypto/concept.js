      <h3>Buying Goods</h3>
      Currently, Bitcoin is the most accepted cryptocurrency, however that is
      changing. Apple recently authorized the use of 10 cryptocurrencies for
      purchases made in the App store, and many other organizations and
      merchants are following suite. Buyers can use cryptocurrencies on websites
      that accept them (such as Overstock, Newegg, Gift Off, Open Bazaar, and
      Bitify). Slowly, digital currencies are moving towards being the norm.
      However, it will take some time for them to become the main mode of all
      transactions all over the world, particularly in third world countries
      that may rely on paper currencies far longer than others.
      <h3>Accepting As Payment</h3>
      Businesses and individual consultants can use cryptocurrencies as a form
      of payment. Platforms like Maester Protocol allow individual consultants
      to offer their services on a per-minute rate and facilitate the instant
      payment for these services the minute their calls are over. Apart from
      this, using gateways like CoinPayments, CoinGate, Cryptonator, and BitPay
      can also help you receive crypto payments (without the added benefits of
      connecting you with potential clients, of course!). Moreover, if you are
      wondering whether you can use these payments in your daily life, it pays
      to know that there are at least 1,800 Crypto ATMs located in 58 different
      countries.
      <h3>Investing</h3>
      People are looking at cryptocurrencies as viable investments as well.
      However, it is worth a mention that cryptocurrencies are quite volatile,
      with values skyrocketing one day and then dropping the next. It will help
      to speak to experts about cryptocurrencies before putting your money into
      them for long term investments. On the other hand, investors also argue
      that stock markets tend to rise and fall sporadically too. So investing in
      cryptocurrency is not without risk, but can prove to be a great investment
      if you play your cards smartly.
